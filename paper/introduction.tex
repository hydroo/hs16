\section{Introduction}

With the release of the C++11 standard in 2011 the C++ community was introduced to several new language and library features~\cite{cpp11std}. Together with a new programming philosophy (see Section~\ref{subs:intro_philosophy}) these changes were so extensive that the original creator of the C++ programming language, Bjarne Stroustrup, felt like it was a ``new language''~\cite{tcpp}.

In this report some of the new features will be presented, especially those which are relevant in a performance analysis context. Additionally, the performance analysis tools Score-P and Vampir will be evaluated with regard to these new changes.
