* new library feature: std::thread (C++11)
* found in header <thread>

STATUS: simple_thread example builds but fails to execute (with scorep 2.0.1):

./simple_thread
[Score-P] src/measurement/thread/create_wait/scorep_thread_create_wait_pthread.c:84: Fatal: Bug 'tpd == 0': Invalid Pthread thread specific data object. Please ensure that all pthread_create calls are instrumented.
terminate called without an active exception
[Score-P] Please report this to support@score-p.org. Thank you.

[1] 3037 abort (core dumped)    ./simple_thread


Problem: std::thread is spawning new pthreads inside an external library (libstdc++ for example). scorep can't handle this currently and crashes as it sees threads that don't "exist" in its scope.
Solution: support unknown threads
