Changes in <fstream>:

* specializations of std::swap for std::basic_filebuf, std::basic_ifstream, std::basic_ofstream, std::basic_fstream (C++11)

* std::basic_filebuf:
    - public operator= added (C++11)
    - public member function swap added (C++11)
    - parent std::basic_streambuf:
        + protected operator= added (C++11)
        + protected member function swap added (C++11)

* std::basic_ifstream:
    - public operator= added (C++11)
    - public member function swap added (C++11)
    - parent std::basic_istream:
        + protected operator= added (C++11)
        + protected member function swap added (C++11)
        + parent std::basic_ios:
            > operator void* changed to operator bool (C++11)
            > protected member function move added (C++11)
            > protected member function swap added (C++11)
            > parent std::ios_base:
                = no changes
    - parent std::basic_ios:
        + see above
    - parent std::ios_base:
        + see above

* std::basic_ofstream:
    - public operator= added (C++11)
    - public member function swap added (C++11)
    - parent std::basic_ostream:
        + protected operator= added (C++11)
        + protected member function swap added (C++11)
        + parent std::basic_ios:
            > see above
        + parent std::ios_base:
            > see above
    - parent std::basic_ios:
        + see above
    - parent std::ios_base:
        + see above

* std::basic_fstream:
    - public operator= added (C++11)
    - public member function swap added (C++11)
    - parent std::basic_istream:
        + see above
    - parent std::basic_ostream:
        + see above
    - parent std::basic_ios:
        + see above
    - parent std::ios_base:
        + see above

Summary: IOStreams haven't changed a lot. C++11 introduced move semantics and the swap algorithm, mainly for using them
in objects that will be moved and/or swapped.
